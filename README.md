## JSON API: Convention-driven API design

This is a talk that I (@steveklabnik) gave at [API Days Paris 2013](http://apidays.io/). I discuss the motivations for building JSON API, show off some examples, and talk about the general idea of media types.

This presentation uses reveal.js, so you can either load up index.html in your browser, or check it out [on GitHub](http://json-api.github.io/conventions_presentation/).
